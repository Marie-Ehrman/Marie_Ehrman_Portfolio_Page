            | Hi! I am Marie Ehrman. I am a Veteran of the US Air Force with an Associates of Science from Portland Community College. I mostly studied Computer Science, Mathematics, Psychology, and Philosophy. While I wasn't sure what I wanted to do for a living, I can say that I truly love figuring out how things work. If they are broken, I like fixing them. If they aren't efficient, I like "refactoring" them. I never knew what I was passionate about until I joined the Treehouse Techdegree Program. I love everything we are learning and the prospect of that process being life-long. I look forward to the opportunity to create amazing things with amazing people!
